If clusterIP is \"None\", no virtual IP is allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather than a virtual IP. \"NodePort\" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP. \"LoadBalancer\" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP. \"ExternalName\" aliases this service to the specified externalName. Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. \"ClusterIP\" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is \"None\", no virtual IP is allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather than a virtual IP. \"NodePort\" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP. \"LoadBalancer\" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP. \"ExternalName\" aliases this service to the specified externalName. Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. \"ClusterIP\" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is \"None\", no virtual IP is allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather than a virtual IP. \"NodePort\" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP. \"LoadBalancer\" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP. \"ExternalName\" aliases this service to the specified externalName. Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is \"None\", no virtual IP is allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather than a virtual IP. \"NodePort\" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP. \"LoadBalancer\" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP. \"ExternalName\" aliases this service to the specified externalName.

The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources for Services interpret this to mean that all endpoints are considered \"ready\" even if the Pods themselves are not.

For backwards compatibility, both fields (DataSource and DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. There are two important differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource only allows two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.

For backwards compatibility, both fields (DataSource and DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. There are two important differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource only allows two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.

The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources for Services interpret this to mean that all endpoints are considered \"ready\" even if the Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.\n                            type: boolean\n                          selector:\n                            additionalProperties:\n                              type: string\n                            description: 'Route service traffic to pods with label keys and values matching this selector.

Valid options are ExternalName,\n                              ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. \"ClusterIP\" allocates\n                              a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to\n                              endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector\n                              or if that is not specified, by manual construction\n                              of an Endpoints object or EndpointSlice objects. If\n                              clusterIP is \"None\", no virtual IP is allocated and\n                              the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather\n                              than a virtual IP. \"NodePort\" builds on ClusterIP and\n                              allocates a port on every node which routes to the same\n                              endpoints as the clusterIP. \"LoadBalancer\" builds on\n                              NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported\n                              in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints\n                              as the clusterIP. \"ExternalName\" aliases this service\n                              to the specified externalName. Several other fields\n                              do not apply to ExternalName services.

Valid options are ExternalName,\n                              ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. \"ClusterIP\" allocates\n                              a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to\n                              endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector\n                              or if that is not specified, by manual construction\n                              of an Endpoints object or EndpointSlice objects. If\n                              clusterIP is \"None\", no virtual IP is allocated and\n                              the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather\n                              than a virtual IP. \"NodePort\" builds on ClusterIP and\n                              allocates a port on every node which routes to the same\n                              endpoints as the clusterIP. \"LoadBalancer\" builds on\n                              NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported\n                              in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints\n                              as the clusterIP. \"ExternalName\" aliases this service\n                              to the specified externalName. Several other fields\n                              do not apply to ExternalName services.

Endpoints are determined by the selector\n                              or if that is not specified, by manual construction\n                              of an Endpoints object or EndpointSlice objects. If\n                              clusterIP is \"None\", no virtual IP is allocated and\n                              the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather\n                              than a virtual IP. \"NodePort\" builds on ClusterIP and\n                              allocates a port on every node which routes to the same\n                              endpoints as the clusterIP. \"LoadBalancer\" builds on\n                              NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported\n                              in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints\n                              as the clusterIP. \"ExternalName\" aliases this service\n                              to the specified externalName. Several other fields\n                              do not apply to ExternalName services.
